# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe game (also known as Xs and Os) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

The goal is to let two players take turns marking spaces in a 3×3 grid. The game should detect wins, draws, and allow players to reset and play again.

Created a 3x3 clickable grid where two players take turns placing "X" and "O". After each move, check for a win or draw and display a message. Include a "Restart Game" button to reset the board.
